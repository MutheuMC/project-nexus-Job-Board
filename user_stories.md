# User Stories for Job Board Backend

## Real-World Application

This project prepares developers to build robust backend systems for platforms requiring complex role management and efficient data retrieval. Participants gain experience with:

- Role-based access control and secure authentication.
- Designing efficient database schemas.
- Optimizing query performance for large datasets.

## Overview

This case study focuses on creating a backend for a Job Board Platform. The backend facilitates job postings, role-based access control, and efficient job search features. It integrates advanced database optimization and comprehensive API documentation.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of the job board backend are:

### API Development

- Build APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.

### Access Control

- Implement role-based access control for admins and users.

### Database Efficiency

- Optimize job search with advanced query indexing.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Django     | High-level Python framework for rapid development |
| PostgreSQL | Database for storing job board data               |
| JWT        | Secure role-based authentication                  |
| Swagger    | API endpoint documentation                        |

## Key Features

### Job Posting Management

- APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving job postings.
- Categorize jobs by industry, location, and type.

### Role-Based Authentication

- Admins can manage jobs and categories.
- Users can apply for jobs and manage applications.

### Optimized Job Search

- Use indexing and optimized queries for efficient job filtering.
- Implement location-based and category-based filtering.

### API Documentation

- Use Swagger for detailed API documentation.
- Host documentation at `/api/docs` for frontend integration.
